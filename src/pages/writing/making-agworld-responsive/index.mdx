# Making [Agworld](https://agworld.com) Responsive

- Agworld hasn't been able to address customers with Android devices
- Part of Agworld's mission is to help alleviate the stress their customers feel by utilising data and insights taken straight from their farms using their own devices
- From very early in Agworld's life, they have offered a rich web product, as well as Apple-device-specific apps
- As the web product was built to be viewed only on a large monitor, customers with Android devices often felt that they were being ignored or were being steered towards using Apple devices

## The Addressable Market Problem

- Becoming extremely difficult to expand that addressable market
- For years, customers have been asking for an Android solution
- Discussed ideas around React Native, Android Native

## A More Adaptive, Responsive Layout

- Important to protect and maintain the current layout
- Sandboxing CSS changes
- Utilising breakpoints and light javascript actions
- CSS Zen Garden
- Coverage for all pages, even if some are a little broken

## Not Perfect, but Really Helps

- Finally opened up Agworld to a whole new addressable market
- As well as helping to identify future areas of improvement
- Instead of deferring the problem, it is clear where to focus effort
- Refactoring is a marathon
