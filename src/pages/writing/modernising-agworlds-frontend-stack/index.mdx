# Modernising [Agworld's](https://agworld.com) Frontend Stack

- Agworld primarily uses Ruby on Rails
- Some aspects of SPA using React
- Design system built in React
- Not scalable across different products without inheriting all aspects of the stack
- How can Agworld's frontend stack adapt and scale in the future?

## Going with the grain

- When thinking about systems that scale, friction is a really important consideration
- If a new system or tool is high-friction, or introduces other aspects of cognitive load, then adoption becomes really difficult
- Agworld developers are very comfortable with Rails
- The easily-achieved benefits of SSR views combined with this comfort needed a shift in thinking for how to handle frontend without using React

## Coherence and Flexibility

- My philosophy for design systems to work is coherence over consistency
- Flexibility over rigidity
- A design system should be resilient enough to handle whatever change is thrown at it
- It may not cater to exactly what is thrown at it, but there should be enough flexibility built in that the system itself doesn't fail
- The design system itself should adapt to changes, not the other way around

## Controversial Choices?

- Styled-components and styled-system are built on atomic principles
- Wanted to bring the same principles to a more SSR context
- Started to look at atomic CSS - Tailwind was an obvious choice
- Use the same design tokens
- Use the same visual components
- Provide flexibility for developers
- Coherence for experiences
- Leverage Tailwind and Stimulus to provide a stellar developer experience

## Everything Coming Together

- The final piece of the puzzle was integration into Signal, Agworld's design system
- A new signal-css package was created that leverages and builds static CSS for use with or without Tailwind
- Development environments (Storybook, Playroom)
- Automatic deployment using Github Actions
- Adapting documentation to handle different contexts

## Best of All Worlds

- Implmenting this adapted frontend stack enabled developers of all sorts of ability to easily create cohesive interfaces with Agworld's design system
- Designers and product managers were also able to work building interfaces using Signal
- Signal is now utilised across 3 different products with unique experiences very successfully
