# [Signal](http://signal.agworld.com) Design System

In 2018, I was recruited by Agworld to help lead and improve the way that their products are designed and built. It was clear that strategies were needed to improve design and frontend efforts across the organisation

With a strong background in frontend development and visual design, I felt there were massive opportunities to provide leadership in these areas. A large part of this resulted in our design system that I named `Signal`

## What could we get better at?

Agworld certainly wasn't starting from scratch - but there were some key areas that I really felt that I could have impact on:

- Introducing guiding principles and improving fundamentals across the board
- Ensuring accessibility is a primary concern
- Abstracting away frontend complexity to help speed

## Built on a Modern Stack

- Fundamentals of atomic CSS
- React, Styled-components (CSS-in-JS), Styled-system
- Monorepo using Lerna
- Github actions
- Automatic deployment of docs
- Automatic deployment of packages

## Architecture

## A Challenging Landscape

- Building solutions that work across products, teams and contexts
- Pivoting towards SSR views using Rails, transitioning away from React
