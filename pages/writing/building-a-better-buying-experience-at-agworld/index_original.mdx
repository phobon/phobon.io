# Building a Better Buying Experience at [Agworld](https://agworld.com)

One of the major projects I worked on at [Agworld](https://agworld.com) for a large part of 2019 was to improve the experience of buying subscriptions for their customers. The aim was to simplify what [Agworld](https://agworld.com) offers so those customers are provided with a tailored experience that is more relevent to them; as well as create a consistent message that the business could align to globally.

## Why this Project was Important

Over its decade-long existence, [Agworld](https://agworld.com) has grown to be a global company; but the way it sold subscriptions hadn't grown with it. There were different offerings based on your **role in agriculture**, your **overall size** as well as your **global region**. Not surprisingly, this created a lot of friction for internal systems and staff, as well as confusing messaging externally. 

For example, a subscription for a large corporate farm shouldn't be the same as one offered to a small family farm, but [Agworld](https://agworld.com) needed to use bespoke arrangements that just weren't flexible, or scalable.

This project was an attempt to alleviate all of those issues, and to provide customers with a clear way of purchasing exactly what they needed without increasing the pressure on staff.

## Taking Bets

This project was a series of experiments:

- Could we change our pricing strategy without alienating our existing customers?
- Could we improve our Annual Contract Value (ACV) without extreme (> 20%) churn?
- Could we work as a cross-functional team?
- Could we be effective with remote product management?

In a design capacity, I was also interested in other experiments:

- Where do we see [Agworld](https://agworld.com) in 5 years?
- Could we experiment on something that looked towards the future of the product?
- Could we design something new, while staying in the consistency spectrum of an established design system ([Signal](http://signal.agworld.com))?

Over the course of the 5 months of the project, my role shifted from `research`, to `UI design` and `prototyping`, then ended with a heavy focus on `front-end development` and `usability testing`

## Research and Why Assumptions are Bad

I made some assumpations at the start of the project. I assumed that there were clearly defined patterns and best practices for how to build a shopping experience in a SaaS business. I thought surely, we can look at something like `Amazon` or `Dropbox`, - or any business that sells software - to see what they do.

It turns out, despite there being some generalised patterns involved, almost every different example I found was bespoke in some way; almost every experience was tailored to the specific needs of their audiences. It's certainly not as simple just taking a shopping cart, or a purchase flow and then plugging it into the product.

Some specific patterns are largely proven to have higher conversion rates, or at least be part of `higher-converting checkout experiences`, but they may not be suitable for our specific audience. A really clear way to know would be to prototype different solutions and test them with [Agworld's](https://agworld.com) target audience.

## Concepts and First Steps

My design process starts with `research`: trends, patterns, discovery and deep exploration. Understanding a broad array of potential aesthetic directions and patterns is very important at this stage of a project.

Sketching and wireframing plays a huge part in exploring basic flows and patterns. These can then be taken through to higher-fidelity prototypes.

### How to Test a Prototype

Overall the first prototype did not test well at all. I observed `frustration`, `anxiety`, and `confusion`; all derived from some key insights:

- There is far **too much information** to parse
- Confusion about **where in the customer journey** this experience appears
- There's **no clear direction about what the plans offered**, or **who they're for**

That last point I think is one of the most important insights to have uncovered from this process. The people that tested the prototype were all familiar with [Agworld's](https://agworld.com) products, familiar with agronomy and the industry in general, but were still not confident that they could make a decision based on what was shown.

</Figure>

The clear direction to move on from here was to:

- Simplify the message
- Give the experience its own space, and make it accessible without having to sign in
- Improve how we describe each subscription, and really hone in on **who** it's for.

One of the most important insights that came out of this project for me is learning just `how important relationships and trust are` in this industry. I've learned first-hand how easy it is to break trust, and how hard it is to build it; so making sure we keep this at the forefront of what we do is paramount.

## Iterations on a Theme

Taking the insights uncovered from the initial set of prototypes as a base, I created further, more refined iterations in the context of [Agworld's](https://agworld.com) product environment. Doing this, I could `rapidly iterate, apply feedback and test at any point` during the project.

## Finishing is Hard

This is a bit of a difficult subject to talk about, but it's important to talk about.

Focus on a project can shift, priorities can change and things can appear at the last minute and you have to adapt to it. This project was definitely not immune to that.

As we were preparing to ship, we had to adapt to changing priorities and implement a different experience that matched the marketing site that was being developed in parallel. It was something that we couldn't incrementally build and ship, so the priority shifted heavily toward getting this change shipped as soon as possible.

</Figure>

I'm really proud of the outcome here. The final implementation is `accessible`, `responsive` and `performant`; all built in-app using [Signal components](http://signal.agworld.com).

[Signal](http://signal.agworld.com) held up exceptionally well; implementing a vastly different and difficult design practically identical to the provided spec.

## On Burnout and Working Sustainably

`This was a really difficult period for me personally, both mentally and physically`. I have been guilty of working unsustainably over my career - which has resulted in periods of burnout, anxiety and depression. This was another period of burnout that I'm still slowly recovering from some 5 months later.

A big part of my life, and my career has been about learning to work sustainably; when to take a step back and when to deep dive. It's something I still struggle with, and probably will for the rest of my career; but I'm learning more and more every day.

## Success in Different Forms

Over the course of a long and difficult project and my own mental health struggles, it's easy to lose sight of the successes that we had along the way:

- The changed pricing strategy resulted in a `~% increase in ACV` in the first 3 months
- The improved buying experience has resulted in `~% higher sales than previous months`
- Reduced the time sales and support staff spend on tasks in this area by `~%`
- Working as a cross-functional team was received extremely positively, and it's now integrated into how we work

Instead of focusing on some of the negative aspects, what are some areas of growth that I can work on?

- Recognise when the physical and mental stress is getting too much and take a step back
- Be more adaptable and positive in the face of challenging circumstances
- Have the confidence and trust in my own abilities

There were some `incredibly challenging aspects` to this project, but in a fast-moving environment there are some expectations that things won't always go smoothly. This project covered the spectrum, and was overall very successful - just in ways I didn't expect.
