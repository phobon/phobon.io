# Building a Better Buying Experience at [Agworld](https://agworld.com)

One of the major projects I worked on at Agworld over the course of 2019 was to improve the experience of buying subscriptions for customers. The aim was to simplify what Agworld offers so those customers are provided with a tailored experience that is more relevent to them; as well as create a consistent message that the business could align to globally.

## Why this Project was Important

Over its decade-long existence, Agworld has grown to be a global company; but the way it sells subscriptions hadn't grown with it. There were different offerings based on your role in agriculture, your overall size as well as your global region. Not surprisingly, this created a lot of friction for internal systems and staff, as well as confusing messaging externally. 

For example, a subscription for a large corporate farm shouldn't be the same as one offered to a small family farm, but Agworld needed to use bespoke arrangements that just weren't flexible, or scalable.

This project was an attempt to alleviate all of those issues, and to provide customers with an excellent, clear way of purchasing exactly what they needed without increasing the pressure on staff.

## Taking Bets

This project was a series of experiments affecting all parts of the company:

- Could we change our pricing strategy without alienating our customers?
- Could we work as a cross-functional team?
- Could we be effective with remote product management?

In my role as a designer on the project, I was also interested in other experiments:

- Where do we see Agworld in 5 years?
- Could we experiment on something that looked towards the future of the product?
- Could we design something that fits these goals, while staying within the consistency spectrum of an established design system?
- Could we adapt and scale processes to reduce bottlenecks?

Over the course of the 5 months of the project, my role shifted from `research`, to `UI design` and `prototyping`, then ended with a heavy focus on `front-end development` and `usability testing`

## Research and Why Assumptions are Bad

I made some assumpations at the start of the project. I assumed that there were clearly defined patterns and best practices for how to build a shopping experience in a SaaS business. I thought surely, we can look at something like `Amazon` or `Dropbox`, - or any business that sells software - to see what they do.

It turns out, there are a few generalised patterns involved, but almost every different example I found was bespoke in some way; every offering was tailored to the specific needs of their audiences. It's certainly not as simple just taking a shopping cart, or a purchase flow and then plugging it into the product.

Some specific patterns were largely proven to have higher conversion rates, or at least be part of `higher-converting checkout experiences`, but they may not be suitable for our specific audience. A really clear way to know would be to prototype different solutions and test them with Agworld's target audience.

## Prototyping

My design process usually starts from research into trends, compiling a moodboard or an inspiration board and determine some different potential aesthetic directions, then spending some time sketching and wireframing different solutions until there are a set of concepts that are taken through to a higher-fidelity of prototype.

** Moodboard **

> A rough moodboard - these all seem to be so different

** Show sketches and wireframes **

> Some initial sketches done on paper

** Show initial prototypes built in-app using Signal**

> It's really important to me to build sustainable processes and systems, so these prototypes were built in-app using Agworld's well-established design system: Signal

### How to Test a Prototype

Testing the prototype was an interesting process. 

- Talk about usability testing outcomes
- Information overload
  - The cognitive load on the user was just too high
- No clear direction about what the plans offered, or who they were for
- Confusion about the place in the app - could people who hadn't logged in purchase the product?

- Outcome was to reduce the amount of information and simplify the message
- Give it its own space and make it accessible without having to log into the product
- Improve how we describe each of the offerings, who is this for? Who does this speak to? Why would I want to choose that offering?

## Higher Fidelity Prototyping

- All of the design work was done in-app, this lets us take the experience at any point and use it to test with
- Feedback and testing outcomes were folded back into the prototype as required

## Finishing is Hard

- While the project was a success, there were some difficult times late in the process that need to be talked about
- The finalised design and implementation of the shopping experience was approved, tested and actually shipped
- The decision was made to make a shift in the aesthetic direction of the experience to bring it more in line with the recently completed marketing website - the website had not been launched until the end of the shopping experience project
- This change was communicated right at the end of the process
- It was quite a difficult outcome for me personally
- Part of working in design and as part of a product team is to ensure that the best interests of the user as well as the business are kept at the forefront
- The goal of the project was to create global alignment, so in my opinion - this would result in the best outcome for the business
- From here we shifted into overdrive to implement the new design

** Show new design **

- The design system held up exceptionally well to implement quite a difficult design as close to the provided spec as possible
- The final implementation is accessible, responsive and performant and uses all design system components

## Success in Different Forms

- The tyranny of distance
  - Challenges arising from PM involvement being largely remote, giving a very small window for collaboration
  - Meant there were periods of time where effective work was stifled, or assumptions made and then corrected or clarified in following meetings
  - Asynchronous communications
    - Decision register
    - Handover messages in Slack
    - Emails used a lot
- Our first real attempt at a truly cross-functional team
  - A lot of those involved were unable to dedicate their entire attention to this particular process
  - It meant that there were quite a few occasions where expectations were not properly managed throughout, leading to some tension when decisions were made without the desired level of consultation
  - It's perfectly fine to not get it 100% right the first time you try; having a 12 hour time difference between members of the team is difficult
- Shift in goals and a Change in design
  - Midway through the second cycle, the decision to rethink the shopping cart was made and a new design was developed
  - This meant a lot of refactoring code to match the new design
  - Large amounts of swarming in order to get the feature developed, tested and polished
  - I'm extremely happy with how our design system handled this pressure, meaning that we were able to shift and change very quickly, and with a great deal of success
