# Building a Better Buying Experience at [Agworld](https://agworld.com)

One of the major projects I worked on at Agworld over the course of 2019 was to improve the experience of buying subscriptions for customers. The aim was to simplify what Agworld offers so those customers are provided with a tailored experience that is more relevent to them; as well as create a consistent message that the business could align to globally.

## Why this Project was Important

Over its decade-long existence, Agworld has grown to be a global company; but the way it sells subscriptions hadn't grown with it. There were different offerings based on your role in agriculture, your overall size as well as your global region. Not surprisingly, this created a lot of friction for internal systems and staff, as well as confusing messaging externally. 

For example, a subscription for a large corporate farm shouldn't be the same as one offered to a small family farm, but Agworld needed to use bespoke arrangements that just weren't flexible, or scalable.

This project was an attempt to alleviate all of those issues, and to provide customers with an excellent, clear way of purchasing exactly what they needed without increasing the pressure on staff.

## Taking Bets

This project was a series of experiments affecting all parts of the company:

- Could we change our pricing strategy without alienating our existing customers?
- Could we improve our Annual Contract Value (ACV) without extreme (> 20%) churn?
- Could we work as a cross-functional team?
- Could we be effective with remote product management?

In my role as a designer on the project, I was also interested in other experiments:

- Where do we see Agworld in 5 years?
- Could we experiment on something that looked towards the future of the product?
- Could we design something that fits these goals, while staying within the consistency spectrum of an established design system?
- Could we adapt and scale processes to reduce bottlenecks?

Over the course of the 5 months of the project, my role shifted from `research`, to `UI design` and `prototyping`, then ended with a heavy focus on `front-end development` and `usability testing`

## Research and Why Assumptions are Bad

I made some assumpations at the start of the project. I assumed that there were clearly defined patterns and best practices for how to build a shopping experience in a SaaS business. I thought surely, we can look at something like `Amazon` or `Dropbox`, - or any business that sells software - to see what they do.

It turns out, there are a few generalised patterns involved, but almost every different example I found was bespoke in some way; every offering was tailored to the specific needs of their audiences. It's certainly not as simple just taking a shopping cart, or a purchase flow and then plugging it into the product.

Some specific patterns were largely proven to have higher conversion rates, or at least be part of `higher-converting checkout experiences`, but they may not be suitable for our specific audience. A really clear way to know would be to prototype different solutions and test them with Agworld's target audience.

## Prototyping

My design process usually starts from research into trends, compiling a moodboard or an inspiration board and determine some different potential aesthetic directions, then spending some time sketching and wireframing different solutions until there are a set of concepts that are taken through to a higher-fidelity of prototype.

### How to Test a Prototype

Overall the first prototype did not test well at all. I observed `frustration`, `anxiety`, `confusion`; all derived from some key insights:

- There is far too much information to parse
- Confusion about where in the customer journey this experience appears
- There's **no clear direction about what the plans offered**, or **who they're for**

That last point I think is one of the most important insights to have uncovered from this process. The users that tested the prototype were familiar with Agworld's products, familiar with agronomy and the industry in general, but were still not confident that they could make a decision based on what was shown.

</FigureGrid>

The clear direction to move on from here was to:

- Simplify the message
- Give the experience its own space, and make it accessible without having to sign in
- Improve how we describe each subscription, and really hone in on **who** it's for.

One of the most important insights that came out of this project for me is learning just how important relationships and trust are in this industry. It's something that I feel we need to lean in on in everything that we do.

## Polish and Ship

Taking the insights uncovered from the initial set of prototypes as a base, I created further, more refined iterations in the context of Agworld's product environment. Doing this, I could rapidly iterate and apply feedback and test at any point during the project.

## Finishing is Hard

This is a bit of a difficult subject to talk about, but it's important to get out there that focus can shift, priorities can change and things can appear at the last minute and you have to adapt to it. This project was definitely not immune to those things.

As we were preparing to ship, we had to adapt to changing priorities and achieve a greater alignment with some work that marketing had been doing in parallel. The short version is that it was something we simply couldn't incrementally build and ship, so the priority turned to implementing this new design and experience.

`This was quite a difficult period for me personally`. Many additional hours of intense work and grind, the understandable hit to my ego - we all have those - but, there's no denying that the change was the best outcome for the business, which is something that's really important to call out.

</Figure>

I'm really proud of the outcome here. The final implementation is accessible, responsive and performant; built in-app using design system components.

The design system held up exceptionally well; implementing a vastly different and difficult design as close to the provided spec as possible.

## Success in Different Forms

Over the course of a long and difficult project, it's easy to lose sight of the successes that we had along the way.

- The changed pricing strategy resulted in a `~% increase in ACV` in the first 3 months
- The improved buying experience has resulted in `~% higher sales than previous months`
- Reduced the time sales and support staff spend on tasks in this area by `~%`
- Working as a cross-functional team was received extremely positively, and it's now integrated into how we work

Instead of focusing on some of the negative aspects, what are some areas of growth that I can work on?

- Learn to not emotionally invest in the work that I do
- Be more adaptable and positive in the face of challenging circumstances
- Have the confidence and trust in my own abilities

There were some incredibly challenging aspects to this project, but in a fast-moving environment there are some expectations that things won't always go smoothly. This project covered the spectrum, and was overall very successful; just in some ways I didn't expect.
