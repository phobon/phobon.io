# Building a Better Buying Experience at [Agworld](https://agworld.com)

One of the major projects I

A major project I worked on at Agworld over the course of 2019 was to align their product offerings globally
The aim was to create a more flexible solution that suited all of the different types of people who use the product - from individual growers to large corporate farms. We hoped that by doing this, we'd be able to alleviate the pressure on sales and support staff, as well as provide a much better representation of the value the product offers to those that use it.

- Agworld expanded into different countries
- Had the same basic and rigid offering for the majority of that time
- Business wanted to create global alignment for the first time in their history
- Provide a more flexible offering to all of the different types of users of the product (Small family farms and staff, Agronomists and staff, all the way up to large corporate farms)
- Be more consistent with the product offering to alleviate pressure on sales and support
- Provide a better representation of the value the product offers

## Cross-Functional, Remote Teams

- Formed a large cross-functional team consisting of product, marketing, development, customer success and business development/sales
- Product management involvement largely remote, providing a very small window of opportunity for interaction
- Asynchronous communication would be a priority
- Given a 6 week period to research, provide tools and make a decision on whether the pricing strategy was feasible from a business and product perspective

## Shifting Roles

- Over the course of 5 months
- Shifted from primarily focusing on design, research, front-end development and usability testing
- Ended with a heavy focus on front-end development and testing

## Taking Bets and Asking Questions

- I wanted to try and explore some different directions with this project
- How to cater for future aesthetic considerations?
  - My mandate was to take a bet on a future aesthetic for the entire product offering
  - Where do I see Agworld in 5 years time?
  - How to incorporate aspects of space, strong hierarchy and contrast in a modern design?
- How to fit this work into systemic considerations?
  - How can we design something that fits our goals, while staying within the consistency spectrum of an established design system?
- It's really important for me to be able to demonstrate the value of a design system by designing with code
- To reduce potential bottlenecks in design and development through strong, supported, well-documented systems

## Research and Why Assumptions are Bad

- I made some assumptions to start the project
- I assumed there were clearly defined patterns and best practices for how to build a shopping Experience
- Surely we can look at something like Amazon, or Dropbox, or (any business that sells software) to see what they do
- There are a few generalised patterns involved, but almost every offering I found was bespoke
- Every offering was tailored to the specific needs of their audiences
- It's not as simple as just taking a shopping cart, or a purchase flow and then plugging it into our product
- Some specific patterns were largely proven to have higher conversion rates, or at least be part of "higher converting checkout experiences", but they may not be suitable for our audience
- Lots of testing and iteration with Agworld's audience would be needed

## Prototyping

- Compiled an inspiration moodboard to determine some potential aesthetic directions

** Show sketches and wireframes **

- Some initial prototypes built in-app using Signal

** Show prototypes **

### Usability testing

- Talk about usability testing outcomes
- Information overload
  - The cognitive load on the user was just too high
- No clear direction about what the plans offered, or who they were for
- Confusion about the place in the app - could people who hadn't logged in purchase the product?

- Outcome was to reduce the amount of information and simplify the message
- Give it its own space and make it accessible without having to log into the product
- Improve how we describe each of the offerings, who is this for? Who does this speak to? Why would I want to choose that offering?

## Higher Fidelity Prototyping

- All of the design work was done in-app, this lets us take the experience at any point and use it to test with
- Feedback and testing outcomes were folded back into the prototype as required

** Show prototype iterations with some highlights **

## Finishing is Hard

- While the project was a success, there were some difficult times late in the process that need to be talked about
- The finalised design and implementation of the shopping experience was approved, tested and actually shipped
- The decision was made to make a shift in the aesthetic direction of the experience to bring it more in line with the recently completed marketing website - the website had not been launched until the end of the shopping experience project
- This change was communicated right at the end of the process
- It was quite a difficult outcome for me personally
- Part of working in design and as part of a product team is to ensure that the best interests of the user as well as the business are kept at the forefront
- The goal of the project was to create global alignment, so in my opinion - this would result in the best outcome for the business
- From here we shifted into overdrive to implement the new design

** Show new design **

- The design system held up exceptionally well to implement quite a difficult design as close to the provided spec as possible
- The final implementation is accessible, responsive and performant and uses all design system components

## Success in Different Forms

- The tyranny of distance
  - Challenges arising from PM involvement being largely remote, giving a very small window for collaboration
  - Meant there were periods of time where effective work was stifled, or assumptions made and then corrected or clarified in following meetings
  - Asynchronous communications
    - Decision register
    - Handover messages in Slack
    - Emails used a lot
- Our first real attempt at a truly cross-functional team
  - A lot of those involved were unable to dedicate their entire attention to this particular process
  - It meant that there were quite a few occasions where expectations were not properly managed throughout, leading to some tension when decisions were made without the desired level of consultation
  - It's perfectly fine to not get it 100% right the first time you try; having a 12 hour time difference between members of the team is difficult
- Shift in goals and a Change in design
  - Midway through the second cycle, the decision to rethink the shopping cart was made and a new design was developed
  - This meant a lot of refactoring code to match the new design
  - Large amounts of swarming in order to get the feature developed, tested and polished
  - I'm extremely happy with how our design system handled this pressure, meaning that we were able to shift and change very quickly, and with a great deal of success
