# [Signal](http://signal.agworld.com) Design System

In 2018, I was recruited by Agworld to help lead and improve the way that their products are designed and built. It was clear that strategies were needed to improve design and frontend efforts across the organisation

With a strong background in frontend development and visual design, I felt there were massive opportunities to provide leadership in these areas. A large part of this resulted in our design system that I named `Signal`

## What could we get better at?

Agworld certainly wasn't starting from scratch - but there were some key areas that I really felt that I could have impact on

There were some key areas that I really felt I could have impact on and lead in:

- Principles and improving fundamentals
- Accessibility as a first-class citizen
- Design evangelism
- Abstracting away frontend complexity - write pure HTML

## Built on a Modern Stack

- Fundamentals of atomic CSS
- React, Styled-components (CSS-in-JS), Styled-system
- Monorepo using Lerna
- Github actions
- Automatic deployment of docs
- Automatic deployment of packages

## Architecture

- Some sort of architecture diagram would be really good here...

### Tokens

- Tokens bring the consistency to the system
- Coherency over consistency
- Enables theming
- Unique solution to dynamic theming

### Primitives, Components, Patterns

- 3 clearly delineated areas
- Examples of each

## Living Documentation

- Abusing JSDoc
- Documentation Site
- Storybook
- Playroom

## Automatic deployment

-

## A Challenging Landscape

- Building solutions that work across products, teams and contexts
- Pivoting towards SSR views using Rails, transitioning away from React
-
